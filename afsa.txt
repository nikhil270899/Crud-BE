First install mongoose 
Connect mongoose
in models folder
Define a Scheme -> which is the stucture of data being stored in collecction
eg : const contactSchema = {
   email: String,
   query: String,
}; 
Then we have to create a model using that schema which is then used to store data in a document as objects.
const Contact = mongoose.model("Contact", contactSchema);
